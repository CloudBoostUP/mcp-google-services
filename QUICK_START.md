# Quick Start - Google Services MCP Server

## 🚀 2-Step Setup

### Step 1: Authenticate (One Command)

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

This opens your browser - sign in with your Google account and you're done!

### Step 2: Use in Cursor

Just ask Cursor:
- "List my Gmail labels"
- "List my Gmail messages"  
- "Backup my Gmail messages"
- "Export my Gmail to JSON"

## ✅ That's It!

No credentials files, no manual setup. Just like `az login` for Azure DevOps.

The MCP server automatically uses your Google Cloud SDK credentials.

## 🔧 If You See "Authentication Required"

The MCP server will show a helpful message with the exact command to run. Just copy and paste it into your terminal!
